Hi there, I'm Muyi Bao (包沐亦). Now I'm a master student (M.S. in ECE) in Carnegie Mellon University. Previously I obtained my B.Eng. degree in Computer Science and Technology from Xi'an Jiaotong Liverpool University in 2025. During undergraduate, I was luck to have collaboration with Prof. [Guangliang Cheng](https://sites.google.com/view/guangliangcheng/homepage), Prof. [Wei Wang](https://scholar.xjtlu.edu.cn/en/persons/WeiWang03) and Prof. [Ming Xu](https://scholar.xjtlu.edu.cn/en/persons/MingXu).


**Talking about Personal Stuffs:**

- 🎓 Education
   - BEng in Computer Science abd Technology (3.92/4.0, Top 5%) – Xi’an Jiaotong-Liverpool University [(XJTLU)](https://www.xjtlu.edu.cn/zh/) - 2021-2025
   - M.S. in Electrical and Computer Engineering - Carnegie Mellon University [(CMU)](https://www.cmu.edu/) (Current) - 2025-2027
- 🔍 Research Interests
   - Computer Vision (3 regular papers and 1 survey paper during my undergrad, focusing on classic CV tasks, i.e. classification, segmentatrion and classification)
   - Undecided for Future focus (maybe multimodal/LLM/Generative AI/Robotics, all seem interesting)
- 📫 Email via muyib@andrew.cmu.edu to reach me if you want to know more about me.
- 🏸 Now, I love play badminton! On June 2025, I completed a half marathon (though it took me 2 hours and 40 minutes).
